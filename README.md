# JB | AG Record Collection

A basic web app that connects to the Discogs API and pulls down the contents of my record collection. Allows for myself and my partner to get data out of Discogs about each album in our collection as well as select a random album when we don't want to make a decision about what to play. I made this mostly to experiment with the Discogs API.

## To Do:
1. Add search function to search through results pulled from API
2. Add sort function to allow for sorting alphabetically, by genre
